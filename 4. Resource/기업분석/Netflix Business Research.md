> 넷플릭스는 1997년 설립되어 DVD 대여 사업에서 온라인 스트리밍 서비스로 전환하며 성장했다. 2018년 기준 미국과 유럽 온라인 비디오 시장 1위를 차지했으며, 전 세계 비디오 스트리밍 시장의 30%를 점유하는 것으로 분석된다. 넷플릭스는 구독 경제를 이끌며, 특히 MZ세대의 소비 트렌드에 부합해 맞춤형 콘텐츠를 제공하는 데 주력했다. 막대한 자본을 바탕으로 오리지널 콘텐츠 투자 및 제작-유통의 수직적 통합을 강화하여 콘텐츠 경쟁력을 확보하고, '정주행' 시청 형태에 맞춰 광고 수익에 의존하지 않는 새로운 수익 구조를 창출했다.

> 그러나 경쟁 OTT 서비스의 등장과 콘텐츠 제공업체들의 자체 OTT 플랫폼 구축으로 인해 경쟁이 심화되고 있다. 디즈니+와 애플TV+ 등 자본력과 콘텐츠 파워를 갖춘 새로운 사업자들의 등장으로 넷플릭스의 입지가 약화될 수 있다는 분석도 제기된다. 이는 플랫폼 사업자와 콘텐츠 제공업체 모두에게 수익성 악화의 위험을 초래하고, 소비자 입장에서는 구독 서비스의 효용 감소로 이어질 수 있다. 실제로 넷플릭스는 러시아-우크라이나 전쟁 이후 유료 구독자 수가 감소하는 등 어려움을 겪고 있으며, 계정 공유 문제 해결 및 요금 인상, 광고 삽입 등의 정책 변화를 모색하고 있다. 이러한 변화가 소비자 효용 감소로 이어질지, 새로운 생태계를 구축할 수 있을지가 관건이다.What path is Netflix on?

  

Netflix was founded in 1997 by Mark Randolph and Reed Hastings, and began service in 1998. At first, it started with a video rental business, went through DVDs, and now it mainly provides online streaming. It has a total of 42 million videos, and as of July 2017, the number of registered households using streaming surpassed 100 million worldwide, and as of the third quarter of 2018, it exceeded 137 million. Of these, 60 million households are owned in the United States alone. It is expanding its services not only to the U.S., but also to Canada, Mexico, some European countries, Korea, and Japan. As of 2018, it ranks first in the online video market in the United States and Europe, and as of 2019, it is analyzed that it accounts for 30% of the global video streaming market. (Record News, 2019)

  

The company is leading the so-called "Cord-Cutting" phenomenon(CNBC 2020). And because of this, the number of subscribers to cable TV is decreasing every year in the United States. It is also the company that is the biggest reason for the narrowing of the position of physical recording media, including Blu-ray, within the media industry. Beyond overtaking video rental companies, global OTT users have already surpassed cable TV subscribers as of 2018. Now the new subscription economy market is familiar to us.

  

Netflix driven by subscription economy

  

In fact, the subscription economy is not a new concept of service. Milk and newspapers, the first-generation regular delivery services, are already the earliest subscription service models commonly found around us. Second-generation subscription services such as water purifiers and massage chair rental, which were developed here, have also been popular for a while. Furthermore, the third-generation subscription economy service can be seen as the subscription economy, which used to be the main stage of offline in the past, has expanded to all industrial areas through online. In particular, as big data, curation, and cloud systems are combined, they have evolved into customized services that properly provide products and services preferred by each consumer.

  

The core consumers of the subscription economy are the MZ generation(Hana bank, 2022) . As the concept of ownership weakened while experiencing a low-growth economy, high unemployment, and job insecurity, they tended to prefer reasonable consumption as much as they used through a flat-rate system. These economic reasons as well as attitudes have changed, and they consider how much more experience they have experienced than how much they own as a more important measure of life's affluence and value improving the quality of life as they experience and feel.

  

With the development of information technology (IT) such as optical communication network technology and the Internet of Things (IoT) and the COVID-19 pandemic situation, the subscription economy has become a consumption trend in the non-face-to-face era. Both consumers and companies are emerging as win-win business models because they can reduce the hassle of going to buy products every time along with price benefits, and companies can secure stable sales by tying customers and predicting demand.

  

Netflix Has Set New Criteria for OTT

  

In the early days of the OTT service business, Netflix was able to settle OTT service in the market early by providing digital content curation services that increase precision as the total size of subscribers increases, creating direct network effects and reselling high-quality content to subscribers.

  

Netflix is expanding investment around original content and strengthening vertical integration of distribution and production, with $7.5 billion accumulated for content asset amortization alone in 2018(KB, 2019). It is trying to establish a virtuous cycle of content investment-subscriber increase-profit expansion.

  

The original content is content that the OTT platform directly or indirectly participates in production and exclusively broadcast through its own platform, giving it competitive edge from other platforms and reducing the risk of content providers leaving. The popular squid game last year is an example.

  

Netflix says most of the most popular content on its platform is original content, and in March 2019, it listed more than 1,000 content on its website's original list. In addition, Netflix was said to have improved the production environment of each country by steadily producing in various countries with increased capital.

  

Netflix's policy to disclose the entire episode at once has also changed the way content is produced and consumed. Existing broadcasting stations made profits by designating advertising unit prices according to ratings, but Netflix also changed the profit structure that relied on advertising as it aimed at Binge Watching.

  

Competition in OTT Market

  

As mentioned earlier, Netflix, which has led the subscription economy service, briefly gained the title of the world's largest entertainment company by surpassing the Walt Disney Company's market capitalization in May 2018 for the first time since its inception. However, the analysis that Netflix was highly valued has been steadily raised. The main challenge was the participation of OTT services by competitors with popular content and strong IP. Netflix emphasizes network effects as its strength, the network effect isn't as strong as that of the Facebook. Mainly because quality content in movies or series is dominated by a few big players.(Bram de Haas, 2018)

  

New OTT services have been steadily entering the market, but for a long time, the two-tier systems of Netflix and Amazon have continued. Subscribers to Netflix and Amazon have also widened the gap significantly with other operators.  This is because it was not easy for small and medium-sized businesses to survive in the OTT market.

  

However, as OTT operators such as Netflix and Amazon gained market power, content production providers began to feel a sense of crisis. Concerned about the growing bargaining power of platform operators, large content providers created their own OTT platform and sold content directly under the D2C structure. As a result, new subscribers such as Disney+ and Apple TV+, which have capital and content power, have recently shown excellent performance in a short period of time, causing changes in the OTT market. In particular, questions have been raised about whether Netflix can make use of its strengths in competition with traditional content companies such as Disney.

  
  

Competition among businesses is a decline in the utility of the subscription economy?

  

This D2C trend in the OTT market is not just bad for Netflix. This can act as a risk of worsening profits for both platform operators and content providers. In addition, from the perspective of consumers, the benefits of subscribing are gradually decreasing because the contents that were previously available on one platform are separated into independent platforms. These limitations can reach the fundamental problems of OTT services, and furthermore, the subscription economy. Competition between companies is often an advantage for consumers, but its utility also decreases. However, the trend seems to be maintained as there is no suitable alternative.

Perhaps because of this trend, Netflix is suffering from a plunge in stock prices day after day in line with problems such as subscriber withdrawal following the Russian War. Netflix's stock price plunged because it revealed that the number of paid subscribers decreased by more than 200,000 in the first quarter of 2022. It is the first time in more than 10 years that the number of Netflix subscribers has decreased since October 2011. In addition, Netflix was greatly disappointed by investors, expecting the number of paid subscribers to decrease by more than 2 million in the second quarter.

  

Of course, Netflix explained that the withdrawal from the Russian market played a decisive role in the decline of subscribers in the first quarter. With the withdrawal of the Russian market, 700,000 paid subscribers have disappeared. Except for this unexpected variable, the number of subscribers increased by 500,000 in the first quarter.

  

Netflix pointed out that account sharing by users is also adversely affecting growth. Netflix said that 100 million households around the world are getting free rides through account sharing. It is expected that the number of subscribers could increase if account sharing is changed to a single account.

  

Several changes in Netflix can lead to a decrease in utility for consumers, and it can be seen that the benefits of the existing subscription economy are gradually disappearing, such as price hikes and advertisement insertion. It is important for each company to decide whether these problems will end up as a chicken game between large OTT companies or create a new ecosystem.
